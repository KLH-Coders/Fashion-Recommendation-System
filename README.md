# Fashion-Recommendation-System
Fashion has witnessed tremendous growth in the textile and fashion industries in recent years. E-commerce platforms offer a multitude of options, making an efficient recommendation system critical to sort, order, and convey relevant product content or information to users. Fashion recommendation systems (FRSs) based on images have attracted a lot of attention from fast-fashion retailers since they enable consumers to create a personalized shopping experience. With advances in technology, this branch of artificial intelligence exhibits an incredible amount of potential when it comes to image processing, parsing, classification, and segmentation. Academic articles on this topic are few despite its enormous potential. The available studies do not provide a rigorous review of fashion recommendation systems and the corresponding filtering techniques.  Moreover, different potential models are presented here that will be used to develop fashion recommendation systems in the future.
